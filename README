NAME
    HTML::Fraction - Encode fractions as HTML entities

SYNOPSIS
      my $fraction = HTML::Fraction->new;
      print $fraction->tweak($html);
  
DESCRIPTION
    The HTML::Fraction encodes fractions as HTML entities. Some very common
    fractions have HTML entities (eg 1/2 is &frac12;). Additionally, common
    vulgar fractions have Unicode characters (eg 1/5 is &#8533;). This
    module takes a string and encodes fractions as entities: this means that
    it will look pretty in the browser.

    Fractions that are supported: 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, 1/3, 2/3, 1/5, 2/5, 3/5,
    4/5, 1/6, 5/6, 1/8, 3/8, 5/8 and 7/8.

    Fractions may be in the string in the form numerator slash denominator
    ("1/5") or in decimal form ("0.5"). Numbers that do not have exact
    decimal representation must be equal to the fraction to two decimal
    places. This module supports converting whole and fractional decimal
    numbers (e.g. "2.25".)

CONSTRUCTOR
  new
    The constructor takes no arguments:

      my $fraction = HTML::Fraction->new;

METHODS
  tweak
    Encode the fractions in the HTML as HTML entities:

      print $fraction->tweak($html);

  tweak_frac
    Encode the fractions that are in the form "1/3" or "5/6" in the HTML as
    HTML entities, but not decimal fractions of the form "0.5".

  tweak_dec
    Encode the fractions that are in the form "0.5" or "0.5" in the HTML as
    HTML entities, but not fractions of the form "1/2" or "1/3".

BUGS
    We don't perform normalisation of the denominator and numerator so "4/6"
    is not converted like "2/3" is. This is intentional

    2.25 doesn't render to the same thing as 2 1/2 (the latter has a space
    between the digit 2 and the fraction.)
